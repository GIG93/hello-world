# hello-world
Hello! My name is Ian Jabari Bone and this my introduction to the world of Github. Although I have never typed a line of code, I am a S.a.a.S. entrepreneur and my team is building the public healthcare app, HouseCall. This is a chronicle of my journey through html, CSS, Python, and many other programming langauges. Wish me luck!
